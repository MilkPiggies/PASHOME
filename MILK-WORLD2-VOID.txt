ORIGIN: Old server made for friends to play together around 2011. The group played 
on this server for quite some time, having multiple cities, artistic builds and more.
The server was whitelisted, so only that group of friends had access, Until one day, 
something changed.

The server had 2 Staff members in charge of keeping the server up and running, overall
the group didint have many problems between eachother, They all mostly got along.

(Eventually, an outsider will join the server undetected. they find an exploit to
keep his name in the whitelist file, Preventing the server staff from removing him.
He is only found after the members start noticing strange builds around the map, 
causing the group to create seperate cities/factions, begining to not trust one another.)

The intruder, once gaining full access to the server, was now able to manipulate the
world, adding in entities that would watch the users. And every now and again, someone
would dissapear, but not only in minecraft.
