:label creation with renewed storage registers/arrays.

goto must first decode what b location we point to.
eg if g[b] is 5letr, and we decoded label, they do not
match, so we increment b.

This will be done in loops until another pointer reaches
a wanted number (so we dont infinitly loop ourselves.)
	^ although, once we reach \n its over.




REMEMBER TO SUBTRACT "goto if " OR "goto " FOR EACH GOTO 
STATEMENT WE ENCOUNTER, WE ONLY WANT TO COMPARE TO THE LABEL
ITSELF, 



	get the line 	(which contains a goto + label)
				compare label with u[b]
					if they are equal, stop loop
					else add one to b
					then goto :loop?



First lets do just goto.

so we get the line that has goto on it, we need to
isolate the labels, this should be easy as we can just
sscanf a variable, or pointer to the label name.
